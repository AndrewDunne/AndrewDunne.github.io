			<p class="galText">Program that takes an input image with a blank background, and generates a 3D mesh of it. I wanted to get experience solving difficult and ambiguous problems with code, so I proposed the project idea.
			 I'm also enthusiastic about 3D graphics and this project let me work with geometry at a fundamental level.

			<p class="galText">Modifiable simulation of leaf growth based off of reaction-diffusion, made in TouchDesigner. The goal of the project was to learn about how to control emergent behaviors in simulations by modifying variables over time, which was the size of branches.

		<div class="gallery">
			<p class="galText">WIP project designed to help gauge people's preference on different types of environmental heterogeneity, such as clustering of trees, amount of woody debris, or presence of water.
			<br>The goal is to determine how to maximize both ecological benefit and human appreciation of wildlife restoration projects.
			<br><br>On the technical side, it uses a custom coded method of spawning objects and performing actions like clustering based on slider values.
			<br><br>Brook Constantz is the primary researcher, I've assisted with planning and developing the application in Unreal 4. All work shown in video by me.</p>

		<div class="gallery">
			<p class="galText">A blog where I look at popular digital art and try to discover how it was made, and what makes it good. The goal is to answer these difficult questions: 'What makes art good?' and 'How do skilled
			digital artists do their craft?'. The site serves as a place to teach people who don't have as much experience in digital art how to analyze their own artwork and other's, because not everyone has access to a good art teacher.
